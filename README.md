# Project Name : 

## STREE - Women Security and Empowerment App

# Description :

People think Women Safety is just raising voice against women violence but it is also about women becoming independent individuals who can face all circumstances and difficulties in their future life.

We have decided to divide the Stree App into mainly 4 modules-

### Women Safety:
The first one is the most important module of all and a necessity in today’s world, a module for the safety and security of women.In this module, we have made multifunctional SOS button that will first start a buzzer at high volume to alert the surroundings that a crime is being committed. Secondly, the app will send an SMS to the emergency contacts of the user with her location.We have also given the feature to add, update and delete emergency contacts to the user. And lastly, the app will start voice recording and will be saved to the cloud. We always hope that nothing should happen to women in our country but if a crime has been committed on her this voice recording will help her to punish the person who did this to her. Realtime Red Zone markings where SOS buttons have been clicked multiple times. Also we can inform nearby police stations about these zones and these places can be protected.


### Marketplace:

The second module will empower women in this country financially. We have made an online marketplace for small entrepreneurs in our country where they can sell their products as well as buy the products from other users. We don’t want to become a middleman like Amazon and Flipkart and provide an open marketplace for everyone free of cost. But we will start charging a one-time fee for a business when they reach a certain level of customers through STREE app. For this module, we have used Firebase and its different features like firebase auth, firebase firestore, realtime database, and firebase storage. The user needs to be logged in to use this feature. The user can use this feature to buy products from other users. As you can see this is a list of products added by other users. We act as a bridge between the buyer and seller to help them to contact each other. To become a seller the user must add her business using this business form. After registering her business she can add her products to our database which will be displayed on the main page of this module. The seller can also see the products she has added.

### Awareness:

Lack of Awareness is the main reason for falling behind. And we all know that we are not that much aware of different Govt. Schemes & Helplines. So for  spreading the Awareness in women we created this module, where we encapsulated the different Helplines & Government Schemes for Women. Using Tabbed-View we created two sections Helplines & Schemes. Helplines section consists of different Helplines & giving accessibility to the user, calling that helpline with only one click. Similarly in the Schemes section by selecting the scheme, users will get redirected to the Official Website of the Ministry of Women & Child Development. 

### Skill Development:

One of the Key factors in Empowerment is to Build & to improve Skills, so we came up with this section of Skill Development. Whether it is Cooking or Learning a new Language, skills help us to achieve our goal. We provide you with some genres like cooking, self-defence & by clicking them you will be redirected to the best YouTube playlists. So that you watch them & improve your skills. 

The main aim of this android application is to empower women. The final product should help to make this world a better place for all women to live in as it mainly focuses on all the important aspects of human life which are very crucial. Even a single needful woman gets help from Stree App would be a huge victory for us! In the end, we conclude that STREE would play a vital role in the overall progress of the female community around the country.
